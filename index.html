            <p>I am Kate Drohan, a first-year student at Algonquin College entering my second semester. My favorite course so far has been web development despite the challenge it poses. I’m looking forward to building on the concepts I learned about in the first semester for the first time.</p>
            <p>In my personal time, I play a lot of video games, one of my go-to comfort games being Overwatch but some of my favourite are indie point-and-click horror games. I love the slow burn of logic-based puzzles and story progression mixed with the tense atmosphere of a horror game.</p>
            <p>When I’m feeling creative I try to paint, draw, make jewelry, or one of my dozen other crafty hobbies. I tend to go in and out of these kinds of hobbies often and sometimes set a project down for years at a time before finding it again and continuing. </p>
